# Hangman Project

This is the documentation page for my hangman project.

Features:
- Hangman class which contains all of the methods associated with the game hangman.
- 'generate_random_word' method which takes a list of words as an input and selects one of them, returning it to a variable.
- 'take_user_guess' method which asks for a single letter user input. The code makes sure that the input is a single character.
- 'check_guess' method which checks if the user guess is in the random word and prints if it is or is not.
- 'take_user_input' method which checks that the user input is a character in the alphabet, and then calls the 'check_guess' method to tell the user if they made a correct guess.
